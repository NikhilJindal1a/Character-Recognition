The project creates a character recognition system using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). It processes images by first converting them to black and white, detecting the shapes of characters, and then extracting and resizing each character for training. The system learns from labeled character images and stores this knowledge for later use. During testing, it detects characters in new images, uses the learned model to classify them, and displays the results by drawing boxes around the characters and showing their predicted labels.
